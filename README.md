# ðŸ¤– DevAccount: Authorized to Click Things

This is a secondary GitHub account created strictly for testing, automated workflows, and poking buttons with Cypress.

### What It Does
- Runs automated browser tests
- Accesses specific repos for validation
- Keeps your main account clean and focused

### What It Doesnâ€™t Do
- Sleep
- Log in like a normal person
- Push actual code (trust me, that's for [@miki-przygoda](https://github.com/miki-przygoda))

ðŸ§ª Automation-powered.  
ðŸ§¼ Human-curated.  
ðŸ”— Controlled access only.

> It logs in. It tests. It disappears.
> It was easier this way trust me...
